# NYPD Shooting Incident Data Project
Simple data analysis project as part of CU Boulder's MS Data Science Program

This project was written in R. Both a .pdf and .rmd file are included in this repository. 

This project aims to briefly analyze NYC shooting incidents and deaths resulting from these incidents across each year. This has been accomplished by implementing several visualizations, which show trends of shootings and deaths by year. This project also highlights a positive, linear correlation between the number of shootings and deaths via the use of modeling. In total, this analysis is brief, and more work can be done to identify trends amongst the following factors: neighborhood, shorter increments of time, victim demographics, and perpetrator demographics.
